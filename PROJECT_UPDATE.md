### Credentials and Security
- All sensitive credentials are stored in `SECURE_CREDENTIALS.md` (not in version control)
- Environment-specific variables are managed through .env files
- AWS credentials are properly secured
- Database credentials are environment-specific

### API Endpoints (Currently Implemented)
- Authentication:
  * POST /api/v1/auth/register/
  * POST /api/v1/auth/login/
  * POST /api/v1/auth/logout/
  * GET /api/v1/auth/profile/
  * PUT /api/v1/auth/profile/update/

### Testing Status
- Basic system tests completed
- Server functionality verified
- API endpoints tested
- Database connections confirmed
- WebSocket functionality verified

## Next Steps (Planned)
1. Frontend Setup (iOS/SwiftUI)
